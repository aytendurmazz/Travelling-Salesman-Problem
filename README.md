# Travelling-Salesman-Problem
Since the program does not know the optimal result when it is run, it iterations up to the number of generations we give and writes the result. It also gives the execution time of this process as NanoTime type output.

When we solve the same problem 5 times, it outputs the minimum values, the average value and the processing time.
